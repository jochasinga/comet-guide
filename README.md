# comet-book

Study guide to OS [the "Comet" book][1] with code examples in Rust.

## objective

- To summarize the content of the book into a sort of study guide
- To port the C code from the book to Rust

The code by no mean tries to emulate the original C code. It tries to stay close when possible, but doesn't go out of the (Rust) way to map to the way C does things.
